_**Optional:** a hint to a part of the project if there's something specific, e.g. the affected insurance type for Adriatic (PUTNO, DRONOVI, SVE...) as an H1 element_

----

**Changes:**

- _describe the added functionalities: added user list route, added generic modal component..._
- _for fixes, describe the cause of the problem and which changes were applied to fix it, e.g. some function was always called because it was missing a condition, the error or weird behaviour were caused by a missing null/undefined check..._
- _write down if there were some special cases and issues, how they were solved and why - this can help later if someone encounters a similar issue or someone wonders why that code is necessary or like that_
- _cover all the changes that can be seen in the commits and files!_

**Testing:**

- _write down the list of requirements for testing - the versions of Node and PHP if it's different for this feature, whether yarn or composer install need to be run, in which directory one should be positioned to run commands..._
- _type out the guide for testing, step by step: which steps to take to reach the implemented feature/fix, which buttons to press, what kind of data to input, what kind of edge-case user behaviour could break it (e.g. something that is specifically handled by the code, or even cases which aren't handled but should maybe pass without handling)..._
- _[optional] for each step where it's relevant, write down the behaviour before the PR along with the behaviour in this PR_
